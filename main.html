        <p>
            Time complexity refers to the measure of how the runtime of an algorithm or program grows with the number of iterations or repetitions it contains. Aiming for efficient running of the program means designing algorithms that can handle larger inputs without significantly increasing runtime, crucial for optimizing performance in various computational tasks.

            <b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of how much memory an algorithm requires to execute, often denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Minimizing it is essential for optimizing memory usage, especially when dealing with large datasets or constrained environments.
